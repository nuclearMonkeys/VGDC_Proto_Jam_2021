[INTRO]
# Player: Some time ago, my eldest cousin, Vok Tregor, decided to take up arms and turn to a path of destruction.

# Player: I must stop him, for only a Tregor can defeat another Tregor.

[LEVEL 1]
# Player: Vok! It is my destiny to destroy you!

# Vok: MWAHAHAHAHA! Oh really? Then perhaps you'll finally give me an interesting fight!

(LOSE): Ha! Are you sure your destiny wasn't TO DIE?

(WIN): Agh! Not like this!

[LEVEL 2]
# Vok: Aha! We meet again, cousin!

# Player: What? I thought I already killed you!

# Vok: Ha! You really thought I would go down that easily? In that case, I have more surprises for you!

(LOSE): ha! Your dead body lies motionless on the floor once again!

(WIN): No! Not a second time! Arrrrgh!

[LEVEL 3]
# Vok: I see that this is becoming a regular occurrence, cousin!

# Player: Oh come on! How many times do I have to kill you?

# Vok: Mwhahaha! Why don't we find out now?

(LOSE): Hm, your death doesn't quite have the luster it once had...

(WIN): Hmph, it was bound to happen at some point.

[LEVEL 4]

# Vok: Oh, it's you again. How many times are you going to fight me?

# Player: I will fight you until you die!

# Vok: ...I see.

(LOSE): Aren't you getting tired of this? You've thrown yourself at me so many times already...

(WIN): I'm getting older, so why aren't you?

[LEVEL 5]

# Vok: You know, I stopped trying to destroy this city a long time ago.

# Vok: It used to mean something to me, but now I'm not quite sure.

# Vok: Knowing this, why are you still coming to me?

# Player: I don't know. But I can't leave this unfinished.

# Vok: Hm. Well then, let's get it over with, shall we?

(LOSE): Come on, I've seen you do better than this before.

(WIN): Ah, I think... this is it.

[ENDING]

# Vok: Well, this is it for me... I think.

# Vok: I've grown too old from these battles.

# Vok: But I suppose something stopped me from abandoning these fights completely.

# Vok: You felt it too, didn't you? That in the end, one of us had to die.

# Vok: I suppose... I was going to die no matter what I did.

# Vok: And now that you've fulfilled your destiny..

# Vok: What are you going to do now?
